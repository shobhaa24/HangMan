# HangMan

This Program starts off with a hangman logo, and selects a random word from the "hangman_words" file.
The player has to guess the letters in the word and has 6 lifelines, and with every wrong answer, the hangman drawing keeps getting completed and when all the 6 chances are done, the complete hangman drawing is shown and the code exits.
